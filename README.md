Settings Made Simple: Head to Tools > Autofill Settings in your WordPress admin to set your Google Places API key and choose how many listings you want per page (e.g., 50). No coding required!<br><br>
Filter Your Listings: Go to Tools > Listeo Bulk Address Autofill. Use filters to show listings with or without a _place_id, or search by location to narrow down your list.<br><br>
Browse with Style: Listings load fast in a sleek, paginated table (with cool button navigation!). You’ll see each listing’s ID, title, location (parsed from _address), _place_id, lat/long, and a link to view it.<br><br>
Autofill Magic: Check the boxes next to the listings you want to update, hit "Autofill Selected Addresses," and the plugin fetches the latest formatted_address from Google using the _place_id. It also updates _geolocation_lat and _geolocation_long for accuracy—all cached for 30 days to save on API calls!<br><br>
Results: See a clean table of updated listings or any errors (e.g., missing _place_id) right on the same page.
